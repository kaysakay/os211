# Top 10 List of Week 09

### 1. [**Network-Attached Storage**](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/data-storage/network-attached-storage)<br>
Network-attached storage (NAS) is a file-level storage architecture that makes stored data more accessible to networked devices. This website tells you about the definition of NAS, how NAS work in hardware and software, and the benefits of using NAS. I like this website because it gives you the complete explanation about how NAS works and it also gives you the diagram flow on the NAS protocols. The diagram helps a lot to understand the explanation.

### 2. [**Disk Attachment**](https://padakuu.com/article/108-disk-attachment)<br>
Computers access disk storage in two ways. One way is via I/O ports (or host-attached storage); this is common on small systems. The other way is via a remote host in a distributed file system; this is referred to as network-attached storage. This site tells you the definition of Host-Attached Storage, Network-Attached Storage, and Storage-Area Network. I like this website because the explanation is easy to understand and it gives you the illustration to make you understand better.

### 3. [**Disk Scheduling Algorithms**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling. This site tells you about the definition of disk scheduling, the important of disk scheduling, and the important terms of disk scheduling, such as seek time, rotational latency, transfer time, disk access time, disk response time. Not only that, this site also tells you about the algorithms of disk scheduling, such as FCFS (First Come First Serve), SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), SCAN, CSCAN, LOOK, CLOOK, RSS, LIFO (Last In, First Out), N-Step SCAN, and FSCAN. They also give explanation about the advantages and disadvantages also the illustration of each algorithms to make it easier to understand.

### 4. [**Magnetic Disk Structure**](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/secondary-storage#)<br>
In modern computers, most of the secondary storage is in the form of magnetic disks.A magnetic disk contains several platters. Each platter is divided into circular shaped tracks. This site gives you the explanation of magnetic disk and the structure of magnetic disk. I like this site because the explanation is easy to understand and it gives you the illustration of the disk structure so it helps you to understand better about the structure.

### 5. [**UEFI vs BIOS**](https://qwords.com/blog/apa-itu-uefi-dan-legacy/#:~:text=UEFI%20singkatan%20dari%20Unified%20Extensible,yang%20ada%20pada%20komputer%20server.)<br>
Firmware dalam komputer ini banyak yang menyebutnya dengan nama BIOS (Basic Input Output System). Firmware seperti BIOS ini memiliki peranan yang penting, jika tidak ada komputer atau laptop tidak akan bisa bekerja dengan normal. UEFI singkatan dari Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. UEFI adalah pembaruan teknologi terbaru dari BIOS yang berfungsi mengupdate fungsi BIOS yang sudah ketinggalan zaman. Dalam website ini terdapat penjelasan mengenai keuntungan dari UEFI daripada BIOS dan perkembangan peralihan dari BIOS menjadi UEFI. Saya menyukai website ini dikarenakan penjelasannya yang mudah dipahami dan terdapat penjelasan mengenai sejarah pergantian perkembangan dari BIOS ke UEFI serta disediakan gambar visualisasi dari BIOS UEFI.

### 6. [**Operating System (Boot) Loader (BOOTMGT, LILO, GRUB)**](https://movelongjourney17.wordpress.com/2010/05/22/pengertian-boot-manager-grub-dan-lilo/)<br>
Boot manager merupakan sebuah aplikasi yang terdapat hampir di seluruh sistem operasi termasuk linux dan digunakan untuk multiple boot. GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) digunakan pada system operasi linux dimana program berukuran kecil yang biasanya muncul setelah BIOS selesai dijalankan. LILO (Linux Loader) dikembangkan untuk Linux dan digunakan untuk memilih Linux atau sistem operasi lain pada saat booting. Saya menyukai website ini dikarenakan pembahasannya mudah dipahami dan menjelaskan bagaimana tiap program bekerja.

### 7. [**OS Initialization (Init, UpStart, Systemd)**](https://www.tecmint.com/systemd-replaces-init-in-linux/)<br>
In Linux, init is a abbreviation for Initialization. The init is a daemon process which starts as soon as the computer starts and continue running till, it is shutdown. A systemd is a System Management Daemon named with UNIX convention to add ‘d‘ at the end of daemon. Similar to init, systemd is the parent of all other processes directly or indirectly and is the first process that starts at boot hence typically assigned a “pid=1“. This site tells you about init and the need to replace init with something more perfect. It also tells you those alternatives that replace init, such as Upstart, Epoch, Mudar, systems. I like this website because the explanation is interesting and easy to understand and it also gives you table that compare the advantages and disadvantages of init and systemd.

### 8. [**RAID (Definition)**](https://www.steadfast.net/blog/almost-everything-you-need-know-about-raid)<br>
RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. That means that RAID is a way of logically putting multiple disks together into a single array. This site tells you about the definition and short overview of RAID, the levels of RAID and its explanation for each level, when to use RAID and the best scenario to use for each RAID level. This site also tells you the difference of RAID in hardware and software also the things that RAID not do. I like this site because it gives you the complete explanation about RAID and the explanation is easy to understand also it gives you the scenario when to use RAID and what level that best for you to use based on the scenario.

### 9. [**Levels of RAID**](https://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid)<br>
RAID is a technology that is used to increase the performance and/or reliability of data storage. The abbreviation stands for either Redundant Array of Independent Drives or Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, which is older and less used. This site tells you all about the levels of RAID and the advantages and disadvantages of each level. I like this website because it gives you the complete explanation about the levels of RAID It gives you the advantages and disadvantages for each level and the ideal use of that level. Not only that, it also gives you the illustrations of how each level work  that makes it easier to understand and spot the differences between each levels.

### 10. [**Cyclic Redundancy Check**](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-fix-cyclic-redundancy-check-data-error/)<br>
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is basically a data verification method that computer uses to check the accuracy of data on the disks (hard disk drive, optical disks such as CD, DVD etc.) CRC detects accidental changes to raw data residing in the storage media. This site tells you how to Solve the Data Error (Cyclic Redundancy Check) Issue using different tools. I like this website because the explanation is easy to understand. It gives you step-step that you can follow to solve the issue and why the issue can occur.
