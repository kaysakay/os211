# Top 10 List of Week 08

### 1. [**CPU Scheduling**](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling#)<br>
CPU scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. This site tells you about the definition of CPU Scheduling in Operating System, types of CPU Scheduling and the criteria of the CPU Scheduling to determine the "best" scheduling algorithm. I like this website because the explanation is easy to understand and it gives you the ilustration to make you understand better about the difference on each types of CPU Scheduling.

### 2. [**Process Scheduling Algorithm**](https://afteracademy.com/blog/process-scheduling-algorithms-in-the-operating-system)<br>
CPU uses some kind of process scheduling algorithms to select one process for its execution amongst so many processes. The process scheduling algorithms are used to maximize CPU utilization by increasing throughput. This site tells you all about process scheduling algorithms also the advantages and disadvantages of each scheduling process.I like this website because it gives you the complete explanation about each scheduling process and they also provide the data table from each scheduling process so that I can understand better the differences between each scheduling process.

### 3. [**Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/#)<br>
Preemptive scheduling is used when a process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state.Non-preemptive Scheduling is used when a process terminates, or a process switches from running to waiting state.This website tells you all about preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling also the differences between the two.I like this website because it tells the key differences between preemptive and non-preemptive and also it gives you the comparison chart to differentiate between preemptive and non-preemptive based on the key parameter and it helps so much to spot the differences between the two.

### 4. [**Rate Monotonic Scheduling**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rate-monotonic-scheduling/#)<br>
Rate monotonic scheduling is a priority algorithm that belongs to the static priority scheduling category of Real Time Operating Systems. It is preemptive in nature. This site tells you all about rate monotonic scheduling such as its scheduling time, its priority, its flow on how it works, its conditions, its advantages and the disadvantages. I like this website because they give complete explanation and also gives the explanation on how to understand the rate monotonic scheduling algorithm data table.

### 5. [**CPU Scheduling Algorithms**](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)<br>
The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.This site tells you all about CPU Scheduling such as its types, the four parameters to determine if scheduling is preemptive or non-preemptive, its terminologies, and the purpose of scheduling algorithm. I like this website because it gives you complete explanation about CPU scheduling algorithm and it also gives the characteristic of each types CPU Scheduling Algorithm so it makes easier to differentiate between each CPU Scheduling Algorithm.

### 6. [**Linux vs Solaris**](https://www.educba.com/linux-vs-solaris/)<br>
Linux is an interface between software and hardware. Linux is one of the best software that provides high stability and dependency while solaris is an operating system based on UNIX OS that was created with the concept of open source and incorporated the source code, including libraries, commands, and kernel. This sites gives you the compelete explanation about the differences of Linux and Solaris, such as the defintion of Linux and Solaris, their key differences, and the head-to-head comparisons between the two. I like this website because of its complete and easy to understand explanation and it gives you the head-to-head differences and comparison chart so it really helps you to spot the differences between the two.

### 7. [**Scheduler and Dispatcher**](https://www.notesjam.com/2018/07/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-system.html)<br>
A dispatcher is a module, it connects the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler. The main function of the dispatcher is switching, it means switching the CPU from one process to another process. This site tells you on how the scheduler and dispatcher work with each other. I like this website because it gives you the diagrams flow on how CPU Scheduling process work and its explanation is easy to understand.

### 8. [**Shortest Job First (SJF)**] (https://www.guru99.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling.html)<br>
Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. This site tells you about the complete explanation on how to understand the process, the differences of Shortest Job First scheduling preemptive and non-preemptive method, the advantages and disadvantages of SJF. I like this website because its explanation about the flow is easy to understand so and it also helps me to understand on how to compute the average waiting time of the SJF process.

### 9. [**Longest Job First Scheduling Algorithm**](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/longest-job-first-scheduling-algorithm)<br>
Longest Job First (LJF) scheduling comes under the category of the non-preemptive scheduling algorithm. This algorithm mainly keeps the track of Burst time of all processes that are available at the arrival time itself and then it will assign the processor to the process having the longest burst time. This site tells you about the procedure of LFJ Scheduling and the disadvantages of LJF Scheduling. I like this website because the explanation of LFJ Scheduling comes along with its example so I can understand better and by reading this article it helps me to understand on how to compute the average time of LJF process.

### 10. [**Differences Between Dispatcher and Scheduler**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-dispatcher-and-scheduler/)<br>
Schedulers are special system software which handle process scheduling in various ways. Their main task is to select the jobs to be submitted into the system and to decide which process to run. A dispatcher is a special program which comes into play after the scheduler. When the scheduler completes its job of selecting a process, it is the dispatcher which takes that process to the desired state/queue. This site tells you the definition of dispatcher and scheduler also it gives you the explanation about their differences. I like this website because the explanation is easy to understand and it also gives you the comparison chart between dispatcher and scheduler so it really helps you to spot the differences between the two and helps to understand better.
